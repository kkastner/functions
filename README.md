This repository contains coding functions that have been written to address various algorithm problems.

There are solutions written using different languages and are described below:

 * cpp - contains solutions written using C++
 * java - contains solutions written using java
 * python - contains solutions written using python

In each directory is a README.md file that contains the problem description for each code file as well as the code's runtime and additional space complexities given in Big-O notation.
